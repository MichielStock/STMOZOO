# Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm

By Thiemen Mussche
The notebook is the main material.

Levenberg-Marquardt is a numerical algorithm specifically made as an improvement to the Gauss-Newton method. 
It employs Gradient descent to counter some disadvantages of Gauss-Newton's method.
Both algorithms are meant to solve nonlinear least square problems. In the notebook we build the algorithms from the ground up
trying to get a more intuitive look at them.

After the theory, the algorithms are implemented and compared, together with gradient descent, on a lowly complex nonlinear function.
