# Super Evolution
## Evolving Supershapes using subjective optimization and fitting Supershapes to images of diatoms, flowers, starfish ... using simulated annealing and MAP-ElitesFitting.

In the notebook, we will explore the Superformula, how it can be used to visualise and explain evolution and how Superformula shapes can be fitted to real images using optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing or the MAP-Elites algorithm.
