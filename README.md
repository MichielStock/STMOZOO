Physarum polycephalum, an acelular slime mold, is well known for its problem solving abilities. In this notebook we explore the Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA) which attempts to replicate this organisms special properties and use it to solve a wider array of problems. We will first look at the biological background and then explore the mathematical background of the algorithm. Finally, we will investigate its performance and compare it to modified versions of the algorithm. 

**Note: The notebook requires a few minutes to generate the figures when first opened. Some of the cells have been dissabled by default to reduce this problem.**
