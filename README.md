# Color transfer using Optimal transportation done right

### Student name : Ju Hyung Lee



Welcome to the color transfer repository in STMO zoo! This is categorized as a 'tool' section of the final project, in which I will make an experiment on color transfer slighty different from the course.

By saying 'experiment', this part of the zoo will explore:

- Implementation of color transfer from the course, but with additional steps.
- Observe the affectations of different parameters in every functions used throughout the color transefer.

All the necessary codes are in notebook/colortransfer.jl
