# Gradient Starvation 🍴💀

Welcome to my STMO project!

I wanted to explore the findings of Pezeshki et al. presented in their publication [Gradient Starvation: A Learning Proclivity in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09468).
The goal was to explain the problem of gradient starvation and to investigate its effects and a proposed remedy on a simple 2D classification task.

The notebook and the code of my project are separated! You can find them in their respective subfolders `notebook` and `src`.

All experiments conducted, including the related figures, can be simply repeated and re-created by running `include("src\\gradientstarvation.jl")` from a Julia REPL.
