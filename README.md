Welcome to the 'Link between fractals and the Newton method' repository in STMO zoo! This is the final assignment for the course Selected Topics in Mathematical Optimization. The goal is to implement an optimization method in Julia and contribute this to this repository.

## Guideline
All the necessary project contents are in the Pluto notebook (notebook/NewtonFractals.jl).

**Table of contents**
- Introduction
- Fractals
- Roots of Polynomials
- Newton's method
- Newton's fractal
- The boundary property
- Reference

In this notebook we discuss the link between fractals and the Newton method. First, we explain what fractals are and where these factals can be found. We then explain what roots of polynomials are and how the Newton's method can approximate these roots. Finally, the link between fractals and the Newton method is made. Here, the important concept called the boundary property will be introduced.

As you can see above, there are many **widgets** such as checkboxes or sliders when you read each line, so please participate and learn from it.
