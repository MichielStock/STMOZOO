Welcome to the color transfer repository in STMO zoo! This is categorized as a 'tool' section of the final project, in which I will make a number of different experiment on color transfer with a few functions.

By saying 'experiment', this part of the zoo will explore:

- Different algorithms for optimal transport (the one used in the course and one from external source)
- Applications in the transfer of color schemes (between & within images)
