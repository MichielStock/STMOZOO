# Fridge
by *Ward Van Belle*

This package tries to find the best recipes for you based on a recipe database. In our eyes (and the eyes of the objective function), the best recipes are the ones that use as much ingredients from your fridge as possible and that don't need extra ingredients from the grocery store.
