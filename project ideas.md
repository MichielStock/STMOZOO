# Project ideas

Here are some suggestions for projects to do. Either pick something from this list or use it as inspiration.

If you choose a project use strikthrought to remove it -> ~~crossed~~

## Methods

Optimization methods not covered in the theory. Provide a working implementation and demonstrate it in the notebook.

- Conjugate gradient descent
- [Cross-entropy method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Entropy_Method)
- Firefly algorithm
- ~~Bee Colony Optimization~~
- Cuckoo search
- maximum flow problems
- Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (for nonlinear regression and inverse kinematics)
- ...

## Applications

Solve a problem using a method from the course or a new one.

- time table scheduling
- analytic solution of a ODE using genetic programming
- ~~solve a Sudoku using local search~~
- graph matching using simulated annealing
- finding negative cycles using the Bellman–Ford algorithm
- multiple sequence alignment using Genetic Algorithms
- using MaxEnt to find the best probability distribution
- [ray tracing with Dijkstra](https://blog.evjang.com/2018/08/dijkstras.html)
- homebrew SVM
- recovering images from a few pixels using [compressed sensing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbU1pahbbkc) (L1-norm minimization)
- visalizing complex networks using quadratic optimization
- ...

## Theortic analysis

Experiment and learn. Show me something exciting about optimization.

- [fitting a neural network by optimizing one weigth at a time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05955)
- search paths of Hill Climbing: an exhaustive search
- non-covergence as a regularization mechanism in machine learning
- improving gradient descent or learning using [gradient startvation](https://mohammadpz.github.io/GradientStarvation.html)
- ...
